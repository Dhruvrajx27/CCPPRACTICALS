/*Consider a situation where a user needs to analyze a set of numbers they input into a system. Imagine a data entry operator who inputs 25 different numbers via the keyboard. The goal is to develop a C program that processes these numbers to determine specific characteristics: how many of the numbers are positive, how many are negative, how many are even, and how many are odd.
