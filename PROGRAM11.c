/*Develop a C program that simulates a matchstick game between the user and the
computer. The objective of the game is to avoid picking the last matchstick. The
program should ensure that the computer always wins by strategically picking
matchsticks. The game starts with 21 matchsticks. The user and the computer take
turns to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks. The player forced to pick the last matchstick
loses the game.
